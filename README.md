This is a minimal menubar Pomodoro app written in Electron. It simply runs a 25 minute timer, resets for a 5 minute break, and repeats until you stop it.

### Installation

There are binaries built for Mac, Windows, and Linux on the [releases page](https://github.com/jasonlong/mater/releases). 

_Note: Currently, I'm not able to test the Windows and Linux builds, so please open an issue if you have any problems._

### Contributions

I don't have plans to add much else at this time, so please open an issue to discuss any feature ideas before implementing them.

### Development

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jasonlong/mater
$ cd mater
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### What's with the name?

I'm a Pixar fan and Mater is awesome. ["Like Ta-mater without the ta"](https://youtu.be/MJm8vNTasMg?t=25s). Get it?
